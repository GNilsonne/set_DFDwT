For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2. Across participants accuracy. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Trials with extreme reproduction errors were removed (0.48% of trials). Mean reproduction errors for each participant in each condition (see Fig. 3) were analysed using a 2 (“Presence of Agency”) × 2 (“Physical Effort”) ANOVA, revealing significant main effects of both of these factors: F(1, 34) = 54.54, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.62, and F(1, 34) = 14.43, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.3, respectively. These main effects were due to larger reproduction errors - more underestimation - in the “Agency” condition than the “No Agency” condition, (M = −322 ms, SD = 236 and M = −56 ms, SD = 265, respectively). This replicates the basic temporal binding effect ( Buehner and Humphreys, 2009; Haggard et al., 2002; Humphreys and Buehner, 2010 ;  Poonian and Cunnington, 2013). There were larger reproduction errors in the “Low” effort compared with “High” effort conditions, M = -208 ms, SD = 230 and M = −170 ms, SD = 228, respectively. However, the critical interaction was non-significant, F(1, 34) = 2.12, p = 0.154, ηp2 = 0.06.

> Although the interaction – critical to our research question – was non-significant, we nevertheless performed two planned contrasts to investigate the nature of effects across “Presence of Agency” and “Physical Effort”. In the “Agency” condition, reproduction errors were significantly larger under “Low” than “High” effort, t(34) = 3.46, p = 0.001, dz = 0.589, while this effect was not significant in the “No Agency” condition, t(34) = 1.59, p = 0.122, dz = 0.27. Therefore, due to a non-significant interaction, the overall results do not support our hypothesis that reproduction errors in agency tasks would be reduced under greater physical effort.
